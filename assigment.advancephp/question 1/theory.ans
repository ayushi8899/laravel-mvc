ans:-1    object oriented programming:- programing pradigm based on the concept of object ,which can contain data and code,data in the from of field and code in the from of procedures.
A common features of object is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object data fields in the brand of oop,there is usally a special name such as 
this or self used refer to the current object.in oop computer program are design by making theam out of object that interface with one another.


ans:-2 there are three major features in object oriented programing that makes them dofferent than non-language: encapsulation ,inheritance,and polymorphism

ans:-3 
         abstract class:- 1)abstract class can have abstact and non abstract method 
                                     2)abstract class doest support multi inheritance
                                     3) abstract class can have final ,non final static and non static variables.
                                      4)abstract class can provide the implement of interface

           interface:- 1) interface can have only abstrsct  methods since java 8 it can have defalut and static method also
                              2) interface support multiple inheritance
                              3) interface has only static and final variable
                              4)interface cant provide the implementation of abstract class


ans:-4 function overloading in php is used to dynamically crete properties and method these dynamic entities are processed by magic methods which can be used in a class for 
          various action types,function overloading contains same function name and that function performans different task according to number of arguments.

ans:-5  
            class:-1) A class can supported and methods both an abstract as well as concrete methods 
                         2) multiple inheritance is not supported 
                         3)final,non-final ,static and non-static variable supported
            
            abstract:- 1)interface can have only abstract methods ,java 8 onward it can have default as well as static methods
                              2) interface support multiple inheritance
                              3) only static and final variable are permitted


jquery :-

ans 1:-  jquery is a lightweight,"write less,do more javascript library
             
            The purpose of jquery is to make it make it much easier to use javascript on your website

            jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

            jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation 
                                      

ans 2:- javascript :  It is a major scripting programming language that is used to make websites more responsive and interactiv.
                                  It is one of the pivoted parts alongside HTML and CSS which are used to create web pages.
                                  If HTML & CSS decorates and designed the web-pages so, Javascript makes the web pages dynamic(we can say it gives them life). 
                                  JavaScript is a major client-side language.

        jquery : JavaScript is a major client-side language            
                      It is the most popular JavaScript library invented by John Resign and was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC. 
                       It is a free, open-source library and It’s a fast, concise, and rich-featured JavaScript library and also has cross-browser compatibility.
                         In a concise manner, we can say that the “JQuery is a library to provide better client-side web page development” environment to the developer with the help of its feature-rich library.


ans 3: diffrence between prop and attr :
  
  prop : This method is used to get the value of a proparty for the first element in the set of matched element

          syntax: $(selector).prop(property)

 attr: This method is used to either fetch the value of an attribute from the first element in the matche set or set attribute
         value onto all matched element.


  ans :  javascript : javascript is a lightweight programming language that is used most often as a component of webpage
                                its webpage implementation enable clients-side script to interct with the user and create dynamic sites
                                 it is a programing language that is interpreted and can handle object-oriented functionality
               
                      1) javascript is interpreted and therefore it is very lightweight.
                      2) it was designed for the purpose of  devloping apps that focus on networks.
                      3)it complements and is fully incorporated with HTML
                      4)it is free to use on serveral operating system 


ex:     
                 <script>
                          document.write("this text in to javascript");
                   </script>

    
               jquery: jquery is a javascript library that was devloped that was devloped in 2006 by john resig. it is know for this 
                           speed and brevity ,jquery makes it easier to move throught HTML pages,handle events
                           use animation and interact with Ajex which makes it faster to build websites.

                         jquery is a javascript library that is efficient , ligweight and compact in size ,it is  compatible with several operating system and browser
                         making it cross-platfrom ,it is also knows as "write less,do more",which is another name for it ,beacuse it takes a large 
                         number of typical activities ,each of which normally needs a larges number of lines of javascript code to do

     

ex:          <script  src=""https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/jquery-3.6.0.js"></script>
                <script>
                          $(document).ready(function() {
                             doctumet.write(this  text in to jquery );
